RESULTS

X-ray of the right face reveals a trigeminal nerve is nerve that comes from the brainstem that goes out to the face and provides the sensory inflammation from the face. The excitability of the nerve is reduced in the CT scan, which results in a CT scan of the bilateral trigemeinal nerve. The CT scan was obtained and reviewed today. The findings are consistent with multiple sclerosis. The MRI results are also consistent with a bilateral bilateral migraine. I have recommended that we start the patient on a steroid to help reduce the excitability. I also recommended that the patient obtain an MRI of the trigemininal nerve to evaluate for any signs of a stroke. I advised the patient that the MRI results will be available in 1 month to review for possible treatment options. He will follow up with me in 2 month to discuss his options."
