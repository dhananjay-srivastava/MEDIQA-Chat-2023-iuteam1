Andrew Mitchell is a 59-year-old male with a past medical history, significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension who presents today with an upper respiratory infection

The patient reports that he was doing a bit of work out in the yard in the last week or so when he started to feel really tired, was short of breath, and felt shortness of breath. He states that he thought it was because he was exerting himself. He denies any seasonal allergies at this time of the year, however, he notes that he has been wearing masks as much at the end of the summer and he thinks it was due to exertion. The patient denies any other symptoms such as muscle aches, joint pain, fatigue, or fever. He notes that his blood pressure has been pretty good for the most part since this episode of his high blood pressure, but notes that it has been a crazy year and a half and he was a little concerned about that. He has been monitoring his blood pressures at home, but has not had a refill of the lisinopril. He is regular about monitoring his glucose levels while he is going to work during the week. He does not have any episodes of episodes of fevers, chills, or weight loss, but he does feel a little warm and has been taking ibuprofen, Tylenol for any fever. isEnabled

He denies seasonal allergies, but states that his recent cold has not been as bad as last time. He adds that he does not believe he has a viral syndrome, but his wife got him into barre classes, to help him relax and I think he is doing well with his weight loss and his weight control.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS


 Constitutional: Denies fevers.
 Musculoskeletal: Endorses joint pain and joint pain in his lower extremities and he does have some pain to palpation of his elbows bilaterally on his lung exam. He reports that his hemoglobin A1c is a little elevated at 8, but I believe that is due to his exertion and not to his allergies. I have referred him to psychotherapy for the next few months to help strengthen his immune system and he will follow up with me in a few months if he continues to improve.

She reports that she drinks a little wine on occasion, and for school, she is currently studying psychology. The patient denies any chest pain, neck pain, or migraines. She notes that her breasts have been in her mind for approximately 6 or 7 years, but has not had a mammogram or ultrasound of her breasts yet. She is currently employed as a chiropractor and has attempted nonsurgical treatments, but the patient states that she is an ideal candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty, which she states is a good time for the patient to be on her new plan.

He does not plan to have any children in the future, but he is going to continue to utilize his chiropractor services for the next 6 to 7 weeks to help with his pain and discomfort. He is also going to start wearing a regular bra for about 6 weeks after surgery, which should help with the scarring and swelling of the breast tissue. He will also continue to use a nipple graft for approximately 1 to 3 weeks after the surgery to help prevent fluid from building up in the breast. He would like to see the breast reduction plan for his children as soon as he is able to get his insurance information. He has also been referred to the Breast reduction Specialist, who will assist with the surgical treatment plan for the reconstruction of his breast.

She states that she was doing well at that time, but notes that when she is moving around a lot, her feet tend to hurt a bit more.

She also notes that the pain is due to prednisoprexate, which can increase bruising when she bumps her feet.

Hyperthyroidism.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Diana Scott is a 100-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a heart murmur. The patient states that she has had severe pains in her legs for approximately 6 months. She denies any chest pain, dizziness, or fatigue. She notes that she does not have any allergies to medicines that she tries to use, but notes that they are completely new as far as she is concerned. She states that her symptoms are consistent with severe aortic stenosis, which she states is due to bilateral leg pain over the last month, considered tavr evaluation following echocardiogram, and she denies any acute distress. She does take statin every day, however, she is on meclizine for this. She reports that some of her lightheadedness and dizziness is related to the aorta stenosis and we will consider a monitor to assess overa- overall cardiac structure and function, as well as her valve view of the carotids. She has not noticed any significant palpitations or lower extremity edema in the past 6 months, but she does feel short of breath at times, especially if she is walking too fast or too long. She is taking levothyroxine, which does not appear to be associated with a heart attack or stroke.


Ms. Scott reports that she is doing well at this time, but has not seen any improvement in her symptoms since that time. She also notes that her blood pressure has not been as high as it was 6 months ago, so she is not sure if this is related with her heart attack, but I do believe that it is mainly due to her leg pain, which is most likely due to severe Aortic Stenosis, for which she is currently asymptomatic and has no history of coronary artery disease or heart failure.
 Medical Reasoning: The patient presents today with symptoms similar to hypolipidemia, for symptoms could be due to the severe AORTic stenotic.
s Patient Education and Counseling: I advised her that she should avoid taking statin for the next 6 months as it is likely that she will be able to stop taking it as she has been taking it. I encouraged her to consider an ischemic evaluation or further monitoring to assess overall burden of the pvcs.

After reviewing the patients examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his recent symptoms. I have explained to him that his symptoms are consistent with constipation and that he should continue with Norvasc. He should contact me if he encounters any issues. I encouraged him to continue with the norvasc if he wishes to contact me but otherwise there is really nothing else to add for that did we forget anything or do you need refills for anything.

An ankle injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of an ankle injury sustained while playing basketball today. The patient states that he landed awkwardly while going for a lap while he was playing basketball. He has a job where he can elevate his ankle regularly. He reports that he has been having trouble walking since he was in a good rhythm going to the gym. He states that when he gets back into working out, he will fall and hurt his ankle. He describes his ankle as feeling a bit bruised up and a bit swollen when he is on crutches. He notes that it feels like he is going to possibly injure his ankle more if he tries to ambulate on it. He adds that he is trying to get back into playing basketball, but it takes a lot of effort to get him back to a good place. He denies any specific injury. He continues to work from home, however, he does play basketball at the gym and enjoys participating in the basketball league. He also enjoys playing basketball with his buddies. He is very active in the gym, but has not been able to participate due to his physical limitations. He currently works from home so he does not participate in basketball tournaments. He attributes his ankle pain to the ambulation of his teammates. He does not like to push on his ankle, however. He feels it is unstable when he ambulates. He endorses ambulation and ambulation. He explains that he likes to keep up shots from way out past the 3 point line. He believes that it is not a good idea for him to do that at this time. He counseled the patient on the importance of strength training and that he should be able to stand on his right ankle for the next 3 to 6 months. He advised the patient to keep his ankle elevated regularly. I advised him to ice his ankle and ice it. I also advised him that if he moves his ankle too much, it will cause him to feel some of that instability when ambulating. He was advised to ice the ankle and keep it elevated. He will follow up with me in 3 months to assess his progress.
